## Introduction
This project is a **Rule-Based Chatbot** that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It doesn't use any machine learning or AI models but instead relies on hardcoded rules and patterns to generate responses.

### Use Cases:
- Customer support for common queries
- Simple FAQs bot for websites
- Quick chatbot prototype for educational purposes

## Features
- Lightweight and easy to set up.
- Provides responses based on keyword matching.
- Easy to customize with new rules and responses.
- No external dependencies, making it ideal for quick deployments.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** is required to run this chatbot.
- Basic understanding of Python is recommended for customization.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-based-chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd rule-based-chatbot
(Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages (if any):
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the chatbot script:
bash
Copy code
python chatbot.py
Enter your queries into the terminal and get responses from the chatbot.
Example Interaction
makefile
Copy code
User: Hi
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
How it Works
The chatbot uses if-else conditions to match user inputs to predefined patterns and keywords. For instance:

If the user says "hello", the bot responds with a greeting.
If the user asks about the chatbot's capabilities, it responds with a description of its functionalities.
Basic Code Structure
python
Copy code
responses = {
    "hello": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "how are you": "I'm just a bot, but thanks for asking!",
    "bye": "Goodbye! Have a nice day!",
}

def chatbot_response(user_input):
    for keyword, response in responses.items():
        if keyword in user_input.lower():
            return response
    return "I'm sorry, I don't understand that."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit", "bye"]:
            print("Bot: Goodbye!")
            break
        print(f"Bot: {chatbot_response(user_input)}")
Customization
To add new responses, simply modify the responses dictionary in chatbot.py:

python
Copy code
responses = {
    "hello": "Hello! How can I help you?",
    "your name": "I'm a rule-based chatbot.",
    "thank you": "You're welcome!",
    # Add more rules here
}
If you'd like to add more complex rules, consider using regular expressions to match patterns more effectively.
