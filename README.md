Tic Tac Toe with AI
📋 Project Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game featuring an AI opponent. The game can be played against the computer, which uses a basic AI algorithm to make its moves. The project is written in Python and uses the terminal for gameplay.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: The core language used to develop the game.
Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses the minimax algorithm for optimal moves.

🚀 How to Run the Game
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic_tac_toe_ai.git
cd tic_tac_toe_ai
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies (if any are listed in requirements.txt):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Game
To start the game, run:

bash
Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
🎮 How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to mark a cell with either 'X' or 'O'.
The player playing 'X' goes first.
The objective is to get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before the opponent does.
The game ends in a draw if the board is filled without any player winning.
Game Modes
Single Player: Play against the AI, which uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Multiplayer: (Optional feature - could be added later)
🧩 AI Strategy
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to choose the best move. This algorithm ensures that the AI either wins or forces a draw, making it unbeatable. The algorithm works by exploring all possible moves and choosing the one that maximizes the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.
